# DanmakU
DanmakU is an high performance, open source development kit for Unity3D focused on simplifying the  development of 2D danmaku games.

### What is Danmaku?
Danmaku (弾幕, lit: "barrage" or "bullet curtain"), called "bullet hell" in the western world, is a subset of shoot 'em ups in which the majority of the screen is occupied by bullets. Some famous examples from this genre include: Ikaruga, Jamestown, Gundemonium, DoDonPachi, and the Touhou Project games.

### Overview
DanmakU is focused on creating, manipulating, and interacting with, for lack of a better word, Danmaku objects. Traditional Unity GameObjects and Components are very versatile and powerful; however, instantiating and controlling hundreds of GameObjects, even with design patterns like object pooling, is incredibly computationally expensive. 

### Getting Started
See the [wiki](https://github.com/rhythmia/DanmakU/wiki) on a number of tutorials on how to get started.  
See the [scripting documentation](http://rhythmia.org/DanmakU/Docs/html/annotated.html) to see a scripting reference.

### Installation

To get DanmakU running in your Unity project, follow these instructions:

1. Go to the releases page for this repository ([link](https://github.com/Rhythmia/DanmakU/releases)) and find the appropriate release version (usually this is the latest release that is for your version of Unity).
2. Download the attached .unitypackage binary.
3. In Unity, open the project you wish to use the development kit with.
4. In the menu at the top, click Assets > Import Package > Custom Package.
5. Navigate to where you downloaded the unitypackage to and open it.
6. It will then prompt you which assets to add. Select all of them, and click Import.
7. Restart Unity. (this refreshes Unity, and pulls up all of the Unity Editor extensions created for this dev kit).

### Source Code Installation/Setup

# DanmakuUnity2D
An open source development kit for Unity intended to create 2D Danmaku, or bullet hell, games.

Largely inspired by Touhou and Touhou Danmakufu. Many of the functions mirror that of many available in Danmakufu.

# Getting Started
See the [wiki](https://github.com/james7132/DanmakuUnity2D/wiki) on a number of tutorials on how to get started.  
See the [script documentation](http://james7132.github.io/DanmakuUnity2D/Docs/html/annotated.html) to see a scripting reference.

# Requirements
This development kit relies heavily on [UnityUtilLib](https://github.com/james7132/UnityUtilLib), a utility library.

ALl releases of DanmakuUnity2D, including the source code releases, come packaged with the version of UnityUtilLib that is used.

#Installation

2. Download the attached .unitypackage binary.
3. In Unity, open the project you wish to use the development kit with.
4. In the menu at the top, click Assets > Import Package > Custom Package.
5. Navigate to where you downloaded the unitypackage to and open it.
6. It will then prompt you which assets to add. Select all of them, and click Import.
